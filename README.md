# Nadia Odunayo

I am a software engineer based in London. I currently run Ignition Works, a company buildling fun and worthwhile tech products, whilst interacting with the tech industry in a sustainable way.

##Web development

As a by-product of exploring tech entrepreneurship, I have also discovered the world of coding, securing a place on the [Code First: Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) course and a fully-paid scholarship to [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), an intensive 12 week software development course.

I've learnt so much since July 2013 and am looking for projects and positions where I can continue to challenge and stretch myself.
